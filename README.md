# Digital Renaissance – NFT Landing Page

This project is a front-end implementation of a provided NFT landing page design.  
The objective was to closely replicate the layout, typography, spacing, and overall visual feel of the reference image while following strict layout constraints.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- CSS Grid 

## Key Features
- Pixel-focused landing page layout
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- CSS Grid used for all layout
- Hover interactions on cards and buttons

## Toughest Part

Matching the NFT card arch proportions and aligning them with
the hero text using ONLY CSS Grid was the most challenging part.
